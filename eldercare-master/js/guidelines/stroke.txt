* Stroke / TIA

summary adapted from the Royal College of Physicians National Stroke Guidelines 2016

** TIA

aspirin 300mg immediately and assessment within 24 hours by specialist clinic

** Acute stroke

urgent brain imaging at most within 1 hour of arrival at hospital

** Acute ischaemic stroke

within 3 hours consider alteplase
consider for combination intravenous thrombolysis amd intra-arterial clot extraction IF proximal intracranial large vessel occlusion causing a disabling neurological deficit (NIHSS score 6 or more) and the procedure can begin within 5 hours of known onset

** Acute haemorrhagic stroke

in primary intracerebral haemorrhage presenting within 6 hours with systolic BP > 150 mmHg treat with locally agreed protocol for BP management aiming to reduce to systolic BP < 140 mmHg for 7 days unless: GCS < 5, large haematoma and death expected, structural cause for haematoma, immediate surgey planned.

** Swallow assessment

screen within 4 hours or arrival at hospital using validated tool by a trained healthcare professional

** Early mobilisation

If medically stable within 24 hours if requires little or no assistance, or short daily mobilisations (sitting out of bed, standing or walking) starting between 24 - 48 hours if they have difficulty moving

** DVT / PE prevention

intermittent pneumatic compression within 3 days of admission if immobile and continue for 30 days or until mobile / discharged

** Hydration and nutrition

If unable to maintain adequate nutrition and fluids orally: refer dietition, consider for NG feeding within 24 hours of admission, assess for nasal bridle if NG tube needs frequent replacement, assessed for gastrostomy if unable to tolerate NG tube

** Blood pressure in stroke / TIA

Target of below 130/80 mmHg, but if severe bilateral carotid disease then target of 140-150 mmHg systolic BP is appropriate.

** Rehabilitation intensity

at least 45 minutes per day
